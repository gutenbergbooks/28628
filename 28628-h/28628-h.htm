	<div id="story">
		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Benjamin Marlowe</span> and
		his young assistant, Larry
		Powell, opened the door of
		the Marlowe laboratory, then
		stopped aghast at
		the sight which
		greeted  their
		startled eyes.</p>

		<p>There on the
		central floor-plate
		directly in the focus of the big
		atomic projector stood the slender
		figure of Joan Marlowe, old Benjamin
		Marlowe’s niece and Larry
		Powell’s fiancee.</p>

		<p>The girl had apparently only been
		awaiting their return to the laboratory
		for around
		her gray laboratory
		smock was
		already fastened
		one of their Silver
		Belts, and a
		cord was already in place running
		from her wrist to the main switch of
		the projection mechanism.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page345" title="345"> </a>Joan’s clear blue eyes sparkled
		with the thrill of high adventure as
		she swiftly raised a slender hand in
		a gesture of warning to the two men.</p>

		<p>“Don’t try to stop me,” she warned
		quietly. “I can jerk the switch and
		be in Arret, before you’ve taken two
		steps. I’m going to Arret, anyway. I
		was only waiting for you to return
		to the laboratory so I’d be sure of
		having you here to bring me back to
		Earth again before I have time to
		get into any serious trouble over
		there.”</p>

		<p>“But, Joan,” Benjamin Marlowe
		protested, “this is sheer madness!
		No one can possibly guess what terrible
		conditions you may confront
		in Arret. We’ve never dared to send
		a human being across the atomic
		barrier yet!”</p>

		<p>“We’ve sent all kinds of animals
		across, though,” Joan retorted calmly,
		“and as long as we recalled them
		within the twelve-hour limit they always
		came back alive and unhurt.
		There’s no reason why a human being
		should not be able to make the
		round trip just as safely. Ever since
		our Silver Belts first came back with
		the weird plant and mineral fragments
		which proved that there really
		is such a place as Arret, I’ve been
		wild to see with my own eyes the
		incredible things that must exist
		there.”</p>

		<p>Joan waved her hand in gay farewell.
		“Good-by, Uncle Ben and
		Larry! I know that you’ll drag me
		back just as quickly as you can possibly
		dash over to the recall switch,
		but I’ll at least have had a few precious
		seconds of sightseeing as
		Earth’s first human visitor to Arret!”</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">Larry Powell</span> was already
		sprinting for the mechanism
		as Joan jerked the cord that ran to
		the switch, but he was barely halfway
		across the intervening space
		when the big atomic projector flared
		forth in a brilliant gush of roseate
		flame.</p>

		<p>For a fraction of a second Joan’s
		slender figure was outlined in the
		very heart of the ruddy glow, then
		vanished completely. There was left
		only a short length of the switch
		cord to indicate that the girl had
		ever stood there.</p>

		<p>Powell reached the mechanism
		and shut off the projector’s flame,
		then turned swiftly to the control-panel
		of the recall mechanism. As
		he closed the switch on this panel,
		three banks of tubes set in triangular
		form around the floor-plate upon
		which Joan had stood glowed a brilliant
		and blinding green.</p>

		<p>Shielding his eyes from the glare
		with an upraised forearm, Powell began
		stepping a rheostat up to more
		and more power. In his anxiety, he
		increased the power far too quickly.
		There was a sudden gush of blue-white
		flame from the heart of the
		mechanism, together with the hissing
		crackle of fusing metal. The
		green light in the tubes promptly
		died.</p>

		<p>Benjamin Marlowe was bending
		over the apparatus almost instantly.
		A moment later he raised a face that
		had suddenly gone white. There was
		terror in his eyes as he turned to his
		assistant.</p>

		<p>“The entire second series of coils
		is burned out, Larry!” he gasped in
		consternation. “Joan is marooned
		over there in Arret—marooned in
		that grim unknown land as completely
		beyond our reach as though
		she were upon one of the moons of
		Mars!”</p>

		<p>For a long moment the two men
		gazed at each other with horror-stricken
		faces, dazed and shaken.
		Then they quickly drew themselves
		together again and set about the herculean
		task of making the necessary
		repairs to the damaged mechanism
		in time to rescue Joan before the
		twelve-hour limit should doom the
		girl to forever remain an exile in
		that land of alien mystery beyond
		the atomic barrier.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><a class="pagenum" id="page346" title="346"> </a><span class="first_word">Their</span> previous experiments
		with animals had proved that
		no living creature from Earth could
		be brought back after it had been in
		Arret over twelve hours. After that
		time the change in the atoms constituting
		living tissues apparently became
		permanently Arretian, for the
		Silver Belts returned without any
		trace of their original wearers.</p>

		<p>The necessary repairs to the damaged
		coils were of such an exacting
		and intricate nature that any great
		speed was impossible. Hours passed
		while the two men bent to their work
		with grim concentration. Neither of
		them dared think too much of what
		nameless dangers might be confronting
		Joan during those weary hours.
		Their actual knowledge of Arret was
		so pitiably slight.</p>

		<p>Some months ago, while they were
		experimenting upon apparatus for
		reversing the electrical charges of
		an atom’s electrons and protons,
		they had first stumbled upon the incredible
		fact that such a place as
		Arret really existed. They found
		that it was another world occupying
		the same position in space as Earth,
		with the fundamental difference in
		the two interwoven planes of existence
		lying in the electrical make-up
		of the atoms that constituted matter
		in each plane.</p>

		<p>On Earth all atoms are composed
		of small heavy protons that are always
		positive in charge, and larger
		lighter electrons that are always
		negative. In Arret the protons were
		negative, and the electrons positive.
		The result was two worlds occupying
		the same space at the same time,
		yet with matter so essentially and
		completely different that each world
		was intangible to the other. They
		had named the unseen world Arret,
		the reverse of Terra.</p>

		<p>Finding it impossible to work directly
		upon most forms of matter,
		the experimenters had finally evolved
		a silver alloy that served as a medium
		both for sending objects into Arret
		and then bringing them back to
		Earth. By focussing the flame of
		the projection apparatus upon a Silver
		Belt of this alloy, the electrical
		charges of the Belt’s atoms were reversed,
		automatically causing the
		Belt to vanish from Earth and materialize
		in Arret. At the same time
		the atoms of any object within the
		Belt’s immediate radius were similarly
		transformed, and that object
		was taken into Arret with the Belt.</p>

		<p>The recall mechanism functioned
		by broadcasting a power wave that
		again reversed the atomic charge of
		the Belt and its contained object
		back to that of Earth. At the same
		time the recall wave exerted an attractive
		force that drew the atoms
		back to a central point in the laboratory,
		where they were re-materialized
		upon the same floor-plate from
		which they had originally been sent.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">The</span> twelve-hour time limit was
		half up when Benjamin Marlowe
		and Larry Powell finally
		straightened up wearily from their
		work over the recall mechanism,
		their repairs completed. It had been
		one o’clock in the afternoon when
		Joan Marlowe vanished from Earth
		in the roseate flare of the projector.
		It was now nearly seven o’clock.</p>

		<p>With nerves tense from anxiety,
		the two men crossed over to the control-panel
		of the recall apparatus.
		This time they donned goggles of
		dark glass to shield their eyes from
		the blinding green glare. Marlowe
		threw the main switch, and the
		banked tubes came to life in a flood
		of vivid emerald light.</p>

		<p>Marlowe began stepping the rheostat
		up gradually to more power, advancing
		it with cautious slowness
		to avoid any chance of a repetition
		of the previous accident. The green
		radiance streaming from the tubes in
		every direction began to throb with
		an electric force that the two men
		could feel pulsing through their
		own bodies.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page347" title="347"> </a>There was a click as the rheostat
		struck the last notch. The green radiance
		was now a searing flame that
		half-blinded them even through the
		thick dark glass of their protective
		goggles, while the vibrant force of
		the green rays was sweeping through
		their bodies with a tingling shock
		that nearly took their breath away.</p>

		<p>Tensely the two men stared at the
		metal floor-plate in the center of the
		area bounded by the flaming green
		tubes. Just over the plate the green
		radiance seemed to be thickening and
		swirling oddly. The swirling eddy
		became a small dense cloud of darker
		green light. Then abruptly, like
		the fade-in on a moving picture
		screen, from the cloud over the plate
		the misty outlines of an object swiftly
		cleared and solidified into a bizarre
		something at whose unfamiliar
		aspect both Marlowe and Powell
		gasped in amazement.</p>

		<p>Marlowe snapped the switch off,
		and the green radiance vanished.
		Stripping the dark goggles from
		their eyes, the two men hurried over
		for a closer view of the thing that
		rested quiescent and apparently lifeless
		there on the metal floor-plate.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">It</span> was shaped like a huge egg, a
		little over a yard long, and was
		apparently composed of a solid lump
		of some unknown crystalline substance
		that closely resembled very
		clear, pale amber. Embedded in the
		heart of the strange egg were clearly
		visible objects which caused Marlowe
		and Powell to gasp in mingled
		horror and amazement.</p>

		<p>Chief among the things imprisoned
		in that amber shroud was the
		Silver Belt that Joan had worn, but
		the Belt was now looped over the
		bony shoulder of a skeleton that by
		no possible stretch of the imagination
		could ever have been that of a
		creature of this Earth.</p>

		<p>The skeleton was still perfectly
		articulated, and gleamed through the
		crystalline amber as though its bony
		surfaces were encrusted with diamond
		dust. The bones were apparently
		those of a creature that in life
		had been half dwarf-ape and half
		giant rat.</p>

		<p>The beast had stood a little under
		a yard in height. The legs were
		short, powerful, and bowed. The
		long arms ended in claw-like travesties
		of hands. The skull was relatively
		small, with a sharply sloping
		forehead and projecting squirrel-like
		teeth that were markedly rodent.</p>

		<p>Around the skeleton’s neck there
		was a wide band of some strange
		gray metal, with its smooth outer
		surface roughly scratched in characters
		that resembled primitive
		hieroglyphics.</p>

		<p>Marlowe’s face was white with
		grief as he turned to Powell. “Joan
		must be dead, Larry,” he said sadly.
		“Otherwise, she would surely never
		have allowed her Silver Belt to pass
		into the possession of—this! She
		knew that the Belt represented her
		only hope of ever being brought
		back to this world.”</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">For</span> a moment Powell stared intently
		into the heart of the
		crystalline egg without answering.
		Then suddenly he straightened up
		with marked excitement upon his
		face.</p>

		<p>“There’s a small sheet of paper entwined
		in the coils of that Belt!” he
		exclaimed. “It may be a message
		from Joan!”</p>

		<p>Swiftly the two men lifted the amber
		egg up to the top of a workbench.
		Powell took a small hammer
		to test the hardness of the strange
		translucent substance.</p>

		<p>He struck it a sharp rap, then recoiled
		in surprise at the effect of
		his blow, for the entire egg instantly
		shattered with a tinkling crash like
		the bursting of a huge glass bubble.
		So complete was the disintegration
		of the egg and the skeleton within
		it that all that remained of either
		<a class="pagenum" id="page348" title="348"> </a>was a heap of diamond and amber
		dust. The only things left intact
		were the Silver Belt and the metal
		collar.</p>

		<p>Powell snatched up the Belt and
		extracted the small piece of paper
		that had been firmly tucked into its
		coils. Hurriedly written in pencil
		upon the paper was a message in a
		handwriting familiar to both Powell
		and Marlowe:</p>

		<div id="letter">
			<p>Help! I am held prisoner in
			the Cave of Blue Flames!</p>
			                 <p class="signature">—Joan.</p>
		</div>

		<p>“Larry, Joan must still be alive
		over there in Arret!” There was new
		hope in Benjamin Marlowe’s voice.</p>

		<p>“Yes, alive and held captive by
		whatever monstrosities may inhabit
		that unknown plane,” Powell agreed
		grimly. “There’s only one way in
		which we can possibly rescue her
		now. That is for you to send me into
		Arret with a reserve Belt for Joan.
		I’ll be ready to start as soon as I get
		a couple of automatic pistols that I
		have up in my room. It’s a sure thing
		that I’ll need them over there in
		Arret.”</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">Five</span> minutes later Powell stood
		ready and waiting upon the
		floor-plate in the focus of the big
		atomic projector, with the central
		lens of the apparatus levelled down
		upon him like a huge searchlight.
		Around Powell’s waist were strapped
		two Silver Belts, and a cartridge belt
		with a holstered .45-calibre automatic
		on either side. His wrist-watch
		was synchronized to the second
		with Benjamin Marlowe’s watch.</p>

		<p>“Joan’s twelve-hour time limit in
		Arret will expire at one o’clock tomorrow
		morning.” Powell reminded
		Marlowe. “That gives me nearly six
		hours in which to find her and equip
		her with a Silver Belt. You will
		broadcast the recall wave at exactly
		one o’clock. If I haven’t succeeded
		in finding Joan by then, I’ll discard
		my own Belt and stay on over there
		in Arret with her…. I’m ready to
		start now, whenever you are.”</p>

		<p>Benjamin Marlowe raised his hand
		to the switch in the projector’s control
		panel. “Good-by, Larry,”—the
		old man’s voice shook a trifle in spite
		of himself—“and may God be with
		you!” He closed the switch.</p>

		<p>A great burst of roseate flame
		leaped toward Powell from the projector.
		The laboratory was instantly
		blotted out in a swirling chaos of
		ruddy radiance that swept him up
		and away like a chip upon a tidal
		wave. There was a long moment during
		which he seemed to hurtle helplessly
		through a universe of swirling
		tinted mists, while great electric
		waves tingled with exquisite poignancy
		through every atom of his
		body.</p>

		<p>Then the mists suddenly cleared
		like the tearing away of a mighty
		curtain, and with startling abruptness
		Powell found himself again in
		a solid world of material things. For
		a moment as he gazed dazedly about
		him he thought that the roseate glow
		of the projector must still be playing
		tricks with his eyesight, for the
		landscape around him was completely
		and incredibly red!</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">He </span>soon realized that the monochrome
		of scarlet was a natural
		aspect of things in Arret. The
		weird vegetation all around him was
		of a uniform glossy red. The sandy
		soil under his feet was dull brick-red.
		High in the reddish-saffron sky
		overhead there blazed a lurid orb of
		blood-red hue, the intense heat of its
		ruddy radiance giving the still dry
		air a nearly tropical temperature.
		From this orb’s position in the sky
		and its size, Powell was forced to
		conclude that it must be the Arretian
		equivalent of Earth’s moon.</p>

		<p>For a moment he stood motionless
		as he peered cautiously around him,
		trying to decide what should be his
		first step in this scarlet world that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page349" title="349"> </a>was so utterly alien in every way to
		his own. On every side the landscape
		stretched monotonously away from
		him in low rolling dunes like the
		frozen ground swell of a crimson sea—dunes
		covered with vegetation of
		a kind never seen upon Earth.</p>

		<p>Not a leaf existed in all that weird
		flora. Instead of leaves or twigs the
		constituent units of bushes and
		grasses consisted of globules, glossy
		spheres of scarlet that ranged in size
		from pinheads to the bulk of large
		pumpkins. The branches of the vegetation
		were formed from strings of
		the globules set edge to edge and
		tapering in size like graduated beads
		strung upon wire, dwindling in bulk
		until the tips of the branches were
		as fragile as the fronds of maidenhair
		fern. The bulk of the shrubbery
		was head-high, and so dense that
		Powell could see for only a couple of
		yards into the thicket in any direction.</p>

		<p>The stillness around Powell was
		complete. Not even a globular twig
		stirred in the hot dry air. Powell
		decided to head for the crest of one
		of the low dunes some fifty feet
		away. From its top he might be able
		to sight something that would give
		a clue to the location of the “Cave
		of Blue Flames” of which Joan had
		written.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">He</span> arrived at the foot of the
		dune’s slope without incident.
		But there he came to an abrupt halt
		as the silence was suddenly shattered
		by a strange sound from the
		shrubbery-covered crest just above
		him. It was a musical, tinkling
		crash, oddly suggestive of a handful
		of thin glass plates shattering
		upon a stone floor. A second later
		there came the agonized scream of
		some creature in its death throes.</p>

		<p>The tinkling, crashing sound
		promptly swelled to a steady pulsing
		song like that of a brittle river of
		crystalline glass surging and breaking
		over granite boulders. There was
		an eery beauty in that tinkling burst
		of melody, yet with the beauty there
		was an intangible suggestion of horror
		that made Powell’s flesh creep.</p>

		<p>The crystalline song swelled to a
		crescendo climax. Then there came
		another sound, a single resonant note
		like that given when a string of a
		bass viol is violently plucked—and
		the tinkling melody abruptly died.
		Immediately following the resonant
		twang some object was ejected from
		the midst of the thicket on the
		dune’s crest, and came rolling and
		bounding down the gentle slope toward
		Powell.</p>

		<p>It finally came to rest against the
		base of a bush almost at his feet. He
		whistled softly in surprise as he saw
		the nature of the thing. It was another
		of the yard-long egg-shaped
		crystals of translucent amber like
		the one that had been materialized
		in Benjamin Marlowe’s laboratory.
		Imprisoned in the clear depths of
		this amber egg was the sparkling,
		diamond-encrusted skeleton of what
		had apparently been a small quadruped
		about the size of a fox.</p>

		<p>Powell’s eyes narrowed in speculation
		as he realized that he had before
		him the first slight clue as to
		what might have happened to Joan.
		Her Silver Belt had been enclosed
		in one of those amber, crystalline
		eggs. Apparently her capture had
		been in some way connected with
		that sinister, unseen Tinkling Death.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">Powell</span> began cautiously working
		his way up the slope of the
		dune, with an automatic pistol
		ready for use in his right hand. Silence
		reigned unbroken now in the
		thicket on the crest, but with each
		upward step that he took there came
		with constantly increasing force a
		feeling of some vast, alien intelligence
		lurking up there, watching
		and waiting.</p>

		<p>Nearer and nearer the crest he
		worked his wary way, until he was
		so close that he fancied he could see
		<a class="pagenum" id="page350" title="350"> </a>the vague outline of some monstrous
		silvery bulk looming there in the
		heart of the red thicket. He took
		another cautious step forward—and
		then his careful stalking was sharply
		interrupted.</p>

		<p>Without a second’s warning there
		came the roaring rush of great wings
		beating the air just above him.
		Powell tried to dive for cover, but
		he was too late. A slender snaky
		tentacle came lashing down and
		struck his shoulder with a force that
		sent him sprawling forward upon
		his face. Before he could rise, two
		of the tentacles twined around him,
		and he was jerked up into the air
		like a wood-grub captured by a husky
		robin.</p>

		<p>Again the great wings above him
		threshed the air in tremendous
		power, as the unseen monster started
		away with its prey. Then the tentacles
		from which he was dangling
		shifted their grip slightly, turning
		Powell’s body in the air so that he
		could look up and get his first
		glimpse of the thing that had captured
		him. He shuddered at what he
		saw. The creature was a hideous
		combination of octopus and giant
		bat.</p>

		<p>Naked wings of membrane
		spanned twenty feet from tip to tip.
		There was a pursy sac-like body,
		ending in a head with staring, lidless
		eyes and a great black beak that
		looked strong enough to shear sheet
		steel. From the body descended half
		a dozen long writhing tentacles.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">Powell’s</span> one hundred and
		eighty pounds made a weight
		that was apparently a burden for
		even this flying monster. It flew
		jerkily along, scarcely a dozen feet
		from the ground, and there was laborious
		effort obvious in every movement
		of its flapping wings. Powell
		decided to make a prompt break for
		escape before the octopus-bat succeeded
		in fighting its way any higher.
		His left arm was still pinioned
		to his body by one of the constricting
		tentacles, but his right hand,
		with the automatic in it, was free.</p>

		<p>He swung the weapon’s muzzle into
		line with the hideous face above
		him, then sent a stream of lead crashing
		upward into the creature’s head.
		The bullet struck squarely home.
		The tentacles tightened convulsively
		with a force that almost cracked
		Powell’s ribs. Then in another
		paroxysm of agony the tentacles
		flung him free.</p>

		<p>The impetus of his fall sent him
		rolling for a dozen feet. Unhurt,
		save for minor scratches and bruises,
		he scrambled to his feet just in time
		to see the mortally wounded octopus-bat
		come crashing down in the
		red vegetation some thirty yards
		away. For a few minutes there was
		audible a convulsive threshing; and
		then there was silence.</p>

		<p>Powell refilled the automatic’s
		clip, then looked about, trying to regain
		his bearings. He wanted to return
		to the thicket of the Tinkling
		Death, but the octopus-bat had carried
		him hundreds of yards from
		there and he was now uncertain even
		of the direction in which the thicket
		was.</p>

		<p>As he paused in indecision, there
		came to Powell’s ears a new sound
		that promptly drove all thought of
		the Tinkling Death from his mind.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">The</span> sound of his gun against
		the octopus-bat had apparently
		attracted new and unseen assailants—and
		their number was legion.
		Swiftly closing in upon him from
		every side there came the rustle and
		whisper of countless thousands of
		unseen foes advancing through the
		dense red thickets.</p>

		<p>Completely hemmed in as he was,
		flight was out of the question. He
		sought the center of a small clearing,
		some ten feet in diameter, in
		order to gain at least a moment’s
		sight of his adversaries before they
		swarmed in upon him. With an automatic
		<a class="pagenum" id="page351" title="351"> </a>in each hand, he waited
		tense and ready.</p>

		<p>The encircling rush came swiftly
		nearer, until Powell was suddenly
		aware that the unseen horde had arrived.
		The thicket bordering his
		tiny clearing was literally alive with
		yard-high furry bodies of creatures
		that dodged about too swiftly in the
		cover of the red bushes for him to
		get a clear view of any of them.
		There was a constant babel of snarling,
		chattering sound as the things
		called back and forth to each other.</p>

		<p>Then the chattering stopped abruptly,
		as though at the command of
		some unseen leader. The next moment
		one of the creatures stepped
		boldly out into full view in the clearing.
		Powell’s scalp crinkled in disgust
		as he realized the nature of the
		thing confronting him.</p>

		<p>It was literally a rat-man. Its upright
		posture upon two powerful,
		bowed hind legs was that of a man,
		but its human-like points were overshadowed
		by a dozen indelible marks
		of the beast. A coat of short, dirty
		gray fur covered the creature from
		head to foot. Its hands and feet were
		claw-like travesties of human members.
		Its pointed, chinless face with
		its projecting teeth and glittering
		little beady eyes was that of a giant
		rodent.</p>

		<p>The beast in the clearing was apparently
		a leader of some sort, for
		around his throat was a wide collar
		of gray metal, with its flat surface
		marked in rudely scratched hieroglyphics.
		Powell’s heart leaped as
		he noted the collar. In this creature
		before him he had his second clue
		to the whereabouts of Joan Marlowe.</p>

		<p>Not only was the collar practically
		identical to the one worn by the
		skeleton that had been materialized
		in the egg back in the laboratory,
		but the skeleton itself was obviously
		that of one of the rat-men. Could it
		be this grotesque horde of human-like
		rodents that was holding Joan
		captive in the Cave of Blue Flames?</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">Powell</span> tried desperately to
		think of some way of communicating
		with the gray-collared leader.
		Then the beast shrilled a command
		that brought hundreds of the beasts
		swarming into the clearing from
		every side, and in the face of the
		menace of their countless glittering
		eyes and bared fangs Powell abandoned
		all thought of attempting to
		parley with the beasts.</p>

		<p>There was another shrill command
		from the leader, and the horde
		closed in. Both of Powell’s guns
		flamed in a crashing leaden hail that
		swept the close-packed ranks of furry
		bodies with murderous effect. But
		he was doomed by sheer weight of
		numbers.</p>

		<p>The rat-men directly in front of
		the blazing pistols wavered momentarily,
		but the press of the hundreds
		behind them swept them inexorably
		forward. Powell emptied both guns
		in a last vain effort. Then he was
		swept from his feet, and the horde
		surged over him.</p>

		<p>Blinded and smothered by the
		dozens of furry bodies that swarmed
		over him, he had hardly a chance to
		even try to fight back. His cartridge-belt
		and guns, his Silver Belts and
		his wrist-watch were stripped from
		him by the dozens of claw-like hands
		that searched his body. Other claw-hands
		jerked his arms behind his
		back and lashed them firmly together
		with rope.</p>

		<p>A blanketing sheet of some heavy
		fabric was crammed over his head
		and tied in place so tightly that he
		was completely blindfolded and
		half-suffocated. A noose was knotted
		around his neck. A suggestive jerk
		of this noose brought Powell lurching
		to his feet; there was another
		commanding jerk, and he obediently
		started walking.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">The</span> march that followed soon
		became torture for the captive.
		Blindfolded as he was, and having
		only the occasional jerks of rope to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page352" title="352"> </a>guide his footsteps, he stumbled and
		fell repeatedly, until his aching body
		seemed one solid mass of bruises.</p>

		<p>As nearly as he could judge, the
		horde had conducted him nearly two
		miles when the path abruptly sloped
		downward. A moment later the sudden
		coolness of the air and the echoes
		about him told him that they had entered
		an underground passage of
		some kind. After traversing this
		passage for several yards they
		emerged into what was apparently a
		large open area, for he could hear
		the excited chattering and squealing
		of countless thousands of rat-men
		on every side of him.</p>

		<p>He was dragged forward a dozen
		steps more, then brought to a halt.
		The blindfolding fabric was roughly
		stripped from his head. For a moment
		he blinked dazedly, half-blinded
		by a glare of blue light that
		flooded the place.</p>

		<p>He was standing in a vast cavern.
		From dozens of fissures high in the
		rock walls streamed flickering sheets
		of blue flame which both warmed
		and lighted the place. There was a
		weird tingling glow in the air that
		suggested that the strange blue fires
		might be electrical in their origin.</p>

		<p>Powell looked eagerly around for
		Joan, but he could see no trace of
		her. The only other living beings in
		the big cavern were the swarming
		thousands of the rat-people. The
		brutes were apparently too low in
		the evolutionary scale to have any
		but the most primitive form of tribal
		organization.</p>

		<p>Sitting on a rude rock throne just
		in front of Powell was a grotesquely
		fat, mangy-furred old rat-man who
		was obviously the king of the horde.
		Some thirty or forty rat-men, larger
		and stronger than their fellows, wore
		the gray-metal collars that apparently
		marked them as minor leaders.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">The</span> great bulk of the horde,
		numbering far into the thousands,
		swarmed in the cavern in one
		vast animal pack, sleeping, feeding,
		snarling, fighting. As Powell was
		halted before the king’s throne, most
		of them abandoned their other pursuits
		to come surging around the
		captive in a jostling, curious mob.</p>

		<p>The metal-collared leader of the
		pack that had captured Powell presented
		the rat-king with the captive’s
		gun-belt and two Silver Belts, accompanying
		the gifts with a squealing
		oration that was apparently a recital
		of the capture. The old monarch
		took the trophies with delight.</p>

		<p>The two Silver Belts were promptly
		draped over his own furry shoulders
		by the king—seemingly following
		the same primitive love for
		adornment that inspires an African
		savage to ornament his person with
		any new and glittering object he
		happens to acquire. The rat-king
		then graciously draped the cartridge-belt
		and holstered automatics around
		the shoulders of the metal-collared
		leader who had captured Powell.</p>

		<p>The king turned his attention back
		to his prisoner. He studied the captive
		curiously for a moment or two,
		then squealed a brief command. A
		score of the rat-men promptly closed
		in upon Powell, and began herding
		him toward a far back corner of the
		big cavern.</p>

		<p>Stopping a few yards away from
		the edge of what seemed to be a
		wide deep pit in the rock floor, the
		guard stripped Powell’s bonds from
		him. Powell made no move to take
		advantage of his freedom, realizing
		that the swarming thousands of rodents
		in the cave made escape out
		of the question for the moment. He
		allowed himself to be docilely
		herded on to the edge of the pit.</p>

		<p>And the next moment he exclaimed
		aloud in delighted surprise
		as he gazed down at the floor of the
		pit ten feet beneath him. There, sitting
		on a low heap of stones on the
		pit’s sandy floor, white-faced and
		weary but apparently unhurt, was
		Joan Marlowe.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><a class="pagenum" id="page353" title="353"> </a><span class="first_word">The</span> girl’s face brightened in relief
		as she looked up and recognized
		him.</p>

		<p>“Larry! Oh, thank God you’ve
		come!”</p>

		<p>The leader of the guards motioned
		for Powell to jump down into the
		pit. He needed no urging. A moment
		later he landed lightly on the
		sandy floor of the pit, and Joan was
		in his arms.</p>

		<p>The rat-men left a dozen of their
		number scattered as sentries around
		the edge of the pit. The rest of them
		returned to the main horde, leaving
		the prisoners to their own devices.</p>

		<p>“I knew that you’d come, Larry,
		as soon as you got my note,” Joan
		exclaimed happily. “But how did you
		ever succeed in finding this Cave of
		Blue Flame?”</p>

		<p>“I didn’t find it myself,” Powell admitted.
		“I was captured like a boob
		and dragged here.” He told Joan of
		his mishaps since arriving in Arret.</p>

		<p>The girl nodded when he had finished.
		“Much the same happened to
		me, Larry, only the red moon wasn’t
		shining then. The only light was
		from what looked like the dim ghost
		of a big yellow sun. I materialized
		in Arret almost in the middle of a
		scouting group of rat-men. They
		took me captive immediately. When
		several minutes passed without you
		and Uncle Benjamin broadcasting
		the recall wave for me, I knew that
		something terrible must have happened
		back in the laboratory, and
		that I might be marooned in Arret
		for hours.</p>

		<p>“I tried to hang onto my Silver
		Belt, of course,” the girl continued,
		“but when I was brought to the cavern
		here I saw that the king was going
		to take it. There was a notebook
		and a pencil in my laboratory
		smock. I managed to write the note
		and twine it into the belt just before
		it was taken from me. The king
		seemed to think the note enhanced
		the Belt’s value as an ornament. He
		was wearing it when I last saw it.
		Was he materialized in the laboratory
		with the Belt?”</p>

		<p>Powell told her of the amber egg
		and the skeleton.</p>

		<p>“The same sort of crystalline amber
		egg that accompanied the work
		of the mysterious Tinkling Death,
		wasn’t it?” Joan mused. “One of the
		king’s lieutenants must have stolen
		the Belt, and reaped prompt retribution
		when he tried to flee. I wonder
		what that weird Tinkling Death
		is?”</p>

		<p>“Possibly some strange weapon of
		the rat-men,” Powell hazarded.</p>

		<p>“No, they are as afraid of it as we
		are. While I was being brought here
		to this cave the Tinkling Death was
		heard several times in the distance,
		and the rat-men were obviously terrified
		at the sound.”</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">The</span> prisoners’ conversation was
		abruptly interrupted by a
		rhythmic, snarling chant from the
		vast horde of rat-men in the cavern
		above. The chant rose and fell in a
		rude cadence that was suggestively
		ritual in nature.</p>

		<p>“They’ve been doing that at intervals
		ever since I was first brought
		here,” Joan commented. “It sounds
		almost like the beginning of some
		primitive religious ceremony, doesn’t
		it?”</p>

		<p>Powell nodded, without telling
		Joan the depressing thought in his
		mind. The rat-men were so low in
		the evolutionary scale as to be little
		more than beasts, and a prominent
		feature of nearly all primitive religious
		rites is the sacrifice of living
		beings. Powell could not help but
		wonder whether the chanting might
		not mark the beginning of rites
		which would end with the sacrifice
		of himself and Joan to some monstrous
		deity of theirs.</p>

		<p>The snarling chant continued with
		monotonous regularity for hours,
		while the prisoners huddled helplessly
		together there on the floor of
		the pit, awaiting the next move of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page354" title="354"> </a>the rat-men. Any thought of escape
		was out of the question. The sheer
		walls of the pit were always guarded
		by alert sentries who had only to call
		to bring the entire horde to their
		help.</p>

		<p>Without Powell’s wrist-watch, the
		captives had no way of accurately
		following the lapse of time, but they
		both realized that the twelve-hour
		time limit upon Joan’s rescue from
		Arret must be coming perilously
		near its end. They waited in momentary
		fear lest a sudden turmoil
		in the cavern above them should indicate
		that Benjamin Marlowe had
		broadcast the recall wave, whisking
		the two Belts back to Earth, together
		with the old rat-king who
		presumably still wore them.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">The</span> chanting above rose slowly
		to a snarling climax, then swiftly
		died away into silence. A moment
		later there came the sound of thousands
		of claw-like feet scratching
		over the rocky floor as the main
		horde apparently began marching
		out of the cavern. A detachment of
		fifty rat-men appeared at the pit’s
		edge.</p>

		<p>A rude metal ladder was shoved
		down to the captives, and a metal-collared
		leader motioned for them to
		climb up. Seeing nothing to be
		gained by refusal, they obeyed. They
		were seized as they reached the top,
		and their hands again bound behind
		them. The overwhelming numbers
		of the rat-men made any attempt at
		resistance futile.</p>

		<p>There was no sign of the main
		horde as Joan and Powell were
		herded out through the empty cavern
		and out into the open air again.
		With their prisoners in the center of
		their group, the rat-men started
		along a well-worn path that wound
		through the red vegetation. Overhead
		the blood-red moon still blazed
		down in lurid splendor.</p>

		<p>From somewhere ahead of them
		the captives began to again hear the
		distant squealing chant of the main
		horde. They steadily approached the
		sound, until abruptly they emerged
		into a huge clearing that had apparently
		been a ceremonial assembly
		place for generations, for its smooth
		sandy floor was packed down nearly
		to the hardness of rock.</p>

		<p>The main horde of rat-men was
		there now, countless thousands of
		them, packed in a roughly crescent-shaped
		mob, with the open side of
		their formation facing what seemed
		to be a large deep pit, some seventy
		yards in circumference. In the clear
		space left between the horde and the
		edge of the pit was a smaller group,
		among them the old king himself.</p>

		<p>Powell’s heart leaped as he noted
		that the Silver Belts were still
		draped over the mangy old monarch’s
		shoulders. If only he and
		Joan could get their hands on those
		precious Belts before Benjamin Marlowe
		broadcast the recall wave that
		would forever snatch them out of
		their reach!</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">The</span> captives were hurried
		through the main horde and
		taken in charge by a score of picked
		guards who herded them on to join
		a small group of four rat-men near
		the pit’s edge. These four rodents
		were apparently also prisoners, for
		their arms were firmly bound behind
		them.</p>

		<p>The rat-king, accompanied only
		by the metal-collared leader, around
		whose shoulders the gun-belt was
		still draped, stood near the pit’s edge
		some ten yards distant from the
		guards and captives. Between the
		prisoners and the rodent monarch
		the edge of the pit jutted out in a
		narrow tongue of rock that extended
		outward for about twenty feet over
		the pit.</p>

		<p>Joan and Powell had barely taken
		their place with the other captives
		when an abrupt and familiar sound
		drew their attention to the floor of
		the pit some thirty feet beneath
		<a class="pagenum" id="page355" title="355"> </a>them. Its smooth sandy bottom was
		clearly visible from where they
		stood. And there on that sandy floor
		were six great gleaming shapes of
		menace which brought involuntary
		gasps of horrified amazement to the
		captives’ lips.</p>

		<p>The faint musical tinkling sound
		as the things moved in occasional
		ponderous restlessness was unmistakable.
		Joan and Powell realized
		that the amazing organisms responsible
		for the mysterious Tinkling
		Death were at last before them.</p>

		<p>The things were giant <em>living</em> crystals—great
		silvery semi-transparent
		shapes nearly ten feet in height,
		their faceted sides pulsing in sinister
		and incredible life as they
		gleamed in unearthly beauty beneath
		the blazing rays of the red moon!</p>

		<p>Near the center of each of the
		giant crystals there was visible
		through the semi-transparent wall a
		large inner nucleus of sullen opalescence
		that ceaselessly swirled and
		eddied.</p>

		<p>Their powers of movement were
		apparently limited to a slow, ponderous,
		half-rocking, half-rolling
		progress on their heavy rounded
		bases. They were now grouped in a
		rough semicircle just under the edge
		of the rocky projection that extended
		out over the pit. The opalescent
		nucleus in every silvery
		faceted form seemed to be “watching”
		with frightening intensity the
		figures on the pit’s edge above them.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">There</span> was no mistaking the
		meaning of the scene. The giant
		carnivorous crystals had obviously
		been lured from their normal habitat
		in Arret’s red vegetation, and
		established there in the big pit by
		the rat-men to act as principals in
		their primitive religious ceremonies.</p>

		<p>Those Devil Crystals waiting
		down there on the pit’s floor were
		waiting to be fed—and the small
		group of captives, rat-men and human
		beings, were to be the feast!</p>

		<p>Utterly sick at heart, Powell wondered
		if they would at least be given
		the boon of a merciful death before
		being hurled over the brink to those
		lurking shapes. He was not left long
		in doubt.</p>

		<p>At a shrill command from the rat-king
		the guards closed in upon the
		captives and herded two of the
		bound rat-men from among them. A
		guard placed to the lips of each of
		the captive brutes a small cup containing
		a faintly cloudy white liquid.
		Apparently resigned to their fate,
		the creatures docilely drained the
		cups.</p>

		<p>The drugged drinks acted with
		startling rapidity. Scarcely a minute
		passed before the rodents’ eyes
		clouded dully, their jaws dropped
		slackly open, and their bodies stiffened
		in almost complete rigidity.</p>

		<p>The bonds were quickly stripped
		from the two stupefied creatures.
		The ceremonial rites apparently required
		that the victims go to their
		doom unbound and of their own volition.
		The guards maneuvered the
		two over to the rocky projection that
		jutted out over the pit.</p>

		<p>Moving with the stiffly wooden
		steps of automatons, the two victims
		started out along the narrow projection,
		leaving the guards behind. On
		they marched, straight for the end of
		the rocky strip—and then, without a
		second’s hesitation, they plunged on
		and over.</p>

		<p>Their bodies crashed to the pit’s
		floor squarely among the group of
		waiting crystals. One of the rat-men
		lay motionless. The other dazedly
		tried to struggle to his feet—but was
		too late.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">From</span> the side of the nearest
		Devil Crystal, some fifteen feet
		away from the dazed rat-man, a cone-shaped
		projection budded with startling
		swiftness.</p>

		<p>A fraction of a second more and
		the projection had lengthened into a
		long slender arm of crystalline silver
		<a class="pagenum" id="page356" title="356"> </a>that streaked across the intervening
		space with the swiftness of a
		spear.</p>

		<p>There was a crashing, tinkling
		sound as the point of the arm struck
		the furry body of the rat-man. Then
		the arm’s point sprayed into a web of
		shining filaments that laced the rodent’s
		body inexorably in their web.</p>

		<p>The arm immediately contracted,
		jerking the victim irresistibly toward
		the waiting crystal. A second
		later the rat-man was pinned against
		the faceted crystalline side just under
		the opalescent nucleus.</p>

		<p>The moment the furry body made
		contact with the crystal’s side a terrifying
		phenomenon occurred. Crystals
		grew and spread all over its
		form with the lightning growth of
		water-glass. Faster and faster clustered
		the crystalline shroud, until
		the furry body was lanced through
		and through—and all the time the
		air was filled with eldritch music as
		of a thousand sheets of thinnest glass
		crashing, tinkling and shattering.</p>

		<p>The crystal growths over the imprisoned
		body rounded their contours
		and merged together until they
		were in the form of a great crystalline
		egg. The outlines of the rodent’s
		body blurred and vanished, melting
		swiftly until only a diamond-encrusted
		skeleton was left. The color
		of the great Devil Crystal began to
		gleam pink as the victim’s flesh and
		blood were absorbed.</p>

		<p>The egg-like excrescence under
		the nucleus turned in hue to pale
		translucent amber in whose depths
		the diamond skeleton gleamed with
		weird brilliance. Then there came a
		sudden twang, as of a violently
		plucked string on a bass viol, and the
		amber egg dropped from the faceted
		side. The Crystal’s feast was over.</p>

		<p>One of the most terrifying aspects
		of the whole thing had been its incredible
		speed. The entire tragedy
		had occurred in but little over two
		minutes from the time the lance-arm
		had first struck the rat-man.</p>

		<p>In the meantime the body of the
		second rodent had been drawn in and
		devoured by another of the carnivorous
		crystalline monsters. There came
		a second twang now, as its skeleton
		in its amber shroud was discarded.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">Powell’s</span> brain reeled as he
		saw the other crystals move
		sluggishly nearer the foot of the
		rocky projection in anticipation of
		the next victims.</p>

		<p>The remaining two captive rat-men
		came next. They were swiftly
		drugged, unbound, and started on
		their dazed march. They trudged
		woodenly out the rocky projection
		to its end, then on and over; and
		again the grim tragedy of the Devil
		Crystal’s feast was repeated, to the
		accompaniment of that eerily beautiful
		crashing, tinkling song.</p>

		<p>The four Devil Crystals that had
		completed their gruesome feast
		moved sluggishly away, leaving the
		space clear for the two crystals that
		remained unfed. The score of guards
		closed in upon Joan and Powell.</p>

		<p>With the crystalline doom at last
		staring them squarely in the face,
		Powell went berserk in a final desperate
		effort to gain even a moment’s
		respite. He lashed out in a writhing,
		kicking flurry that almost
		cleared the space around them.</p>

		<p>Then three of the rat-men slipped
		behind him, and a second later his
		feet were jerked from under him.
		His bound arms made him helpless to
		avert his fall, and he crashed heavily
		to the ground. Then a dozen of the
		powerful little beasts swarmed over
		him, completely overpowering him
		by their numbers.</p>

		<p>Claw-like hands pried his set jaws
		apart. A cup of the cloudy white liquid
		was pressed to his lips. He
		choked; then, unable to help himself,
		he had to let the stuff pour
		down his throat. It had an acid taste
		faintly reminiscent of lemons. The
		rat-men apparently wanted to make
		sure of giving him enough, for they
		<a class="pagenum" id="page357" title="357"> </a>poured another full cup of the liquid
		down his throat before releasing him.</p>

		<p>The guards then fell back and
		Powell stumbled to his feet. Joan
		was already up again, standing close
		beside him. From the wry expression
		upon her face, Powell knew that
		she had also been given the drugged
		potion.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">For</span> a long minute the two stood
		there with every nerve trembling
		as they helplessly waited for
		the paralyzing numbness to sweep
		over their bodies. The seconds
		passed slowly, and still their minds
		remained as clear as though the drug
		had been water. Another full minute
		elapsed without effect, before they
		could finally convince themselves of
		the amazing truth.</p>

		<p>The drugged drink of the rat-men,
		instantly paralyzing to those of their
		own rodent race, was utterly harmless
		to the human being from another
		world!</p>

		<p>Powell instantly realized the forlorn
		last chance their unexpected
		immunity to the drug gave them.</p>

		<p>“Play ’possum, Joan!” he whispered
		tensely. “Then we’ll make a
		break for the king and those Belts!”</p>

		<p>Joan nodded slightly in quick understanding.
		Powell let his jaw drop
		slack and open, and stiffened his
		body in imitation of the stupor the
		rodent drug victims had shown. Joan
		promptly followed his lead. The
		alertly watching guards relaxed their
		tense vigilance in obvious relief.</p>

		<p>The guards waited another minute
		to be sure of the drug’s effects. Then,
		apparently satisfied, they stepped
		forward and unbound the two prisoners.
		Powell let his bonds drop
		from him without making a hostile
		move of any kind. He wanted first
		to wait until he was free of the encircling
		guards.</p>

		<p>The rat-men maneuvered the two
		into position, and prodded them forward
		toward the projecting point of
		rock. They obediently began their
		march, simulating as best they could
		the wooden mechanical gait of the
		drug victims. Powell saw from the
		corner of his eye that Joan was
		tensely watching his face for a sign
		from him.</p>

		<p>As the captives reached the narrow
		projection the guards dropped a
		couple of yards behind and halted to
		watch. It was the chance for which
		Powell had been waiting.</p>

		<p>“Let’s go!” he shouted to Joan.
		The girl, alert for his signal, was
		right beside him as they wheeled and
		dashed at break-neck speed for the
		rat-king and his sole lieutenant, some
		ten yards away.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">They</span> were upon the two startled
		rodent leaders before they even
		realized what was happening. Powell
		swept the squirming old king up in
		the air, tore the Silver Belts from
		about the monarch’s shoulders, and
		flung the creature sprawling and
		senseless at the pit’s edge.</p>

		<p>The lieutenant leaped for Powell’s
		throat in a belated effort at rescue,
		but Powell smashed a solid fist
		squarely into its snarling face, and
		the brute collapsed with a broken
		neck.</p>

		<p>Snatching his gun-belt from the
		fallen rat-man, Powell crammed new
		clips of ammunition into the two
		guns and wheeled to confront the
		rest of the rat-men. The detachment
		of guards, demoralized by the dazzling
		speed of the captives’ sortie,
		were milling in obvious uncertainty.</p>

		<p>Behind them the thousands of the
		main horde were chattering and
		squealing in excited frenzy, dazed
		and bewildered by their king’s swift
		overthrow. The whole clearing was
		a seething mob of excited beasts,
		stunned for the moment, but ready
		at any second to rally from their
		shock and surge forward in a furious
		charge that would sweep everything
		before it.</p>

		<p>Powell menaced the rat-men with
		levelled guns while Joan, with fingers
		<a class="pagenum" id="page358" title="358"> </a>that shook from excitement and
		haste, quietly buckled one of the Silver
		Belts around each of them.</p>

		<p>The guards rallied from their panic
		first. At a shrill command from their
		leader, they began cautiously edging
		forward toward Joan and Powell.
		The two gave ground slowly, working
		their way back over toward the
		projecting tongue of rock. Out on
		the end of that narrow strip, Powell
		knew that he could hold the horde at
		bay for a few moments at least.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">They</span> reached the rocky projection,
		and began backing slowly
		and carefully out toward its end. The
		guards, galvanized into action by
		their captives’ retreat, suddenly came
		surging forward in a furious charge.</p>

		<p>Powell emptied the two automatics
		in a crashing volley that nearly
		wiped out the charging guards.
		The few survivors turned and fled in
		panic back to the main horde. Powell
		reloaded his clips with feverish
		haste.</p>

		<p>The thousands of rat-men in the
		main horde were now milling in what
		was apparently a last moment of hesitation
		before surging forward in an
		irresistible stampede toward the beleaguered
		two out on the rocky strip.</p>

		<p>Several bolder individuals at the
		edge of the horde edged a step forward.
		Their example was followed
		by a hundred others. Another hesitant
		step or two—and then the whole
		horde was in motion.</p>

		<p>Powell swept the front rank with
		a rain of lead from one of the automatics,
		holding the other as a reserve.
		The heavy bullets plowed
		murder into the close-packed furry
		bodies. The charge wavered momentarily.
		Then Powell felt Joan tugging
		frantically at his arm.</p>

		<p>“Larry, the rocks under us are
		crumbling!” she cried. “We’ll be
		hurled down into the pit!”</p>

		<p>Even as she spoke, Powell felt the
		narrow strip of rock under them
		quiver and settle. He looked quickly
		down. All along its length, the narrow
		rocky projection, weakened by
		their weight, was breaking swiftly
		away from the pit’s edge. And on
		the floor of the pit below them the
		two waiting Devil Crystals moved
		with musical, tinkling sounds as
		they waited restlessly for their prey
		to fall among them.</p>

		<p>The horde of rat-men rallied and
		swept on forward in a wave that
		nothing could have stopped this time—but
		their charge was too late. The
		entire rocky projection collapsed
		with a final sickening lurch, and slid
		to the pit’s floor, carrying Joan and
		Powell with it in a miniature avalanche
		of rocky rubble.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">Even</span> in the chaos of their wild
		descent, Powell retained his
		grip upon the loaded automatic in
		his hand. They struck the bottom
		and staggered half-dazed to their
		feet, to confront the two crystalline
		monsters rocking on their rounded
		bases scarcely ten feet away.</p>

		<p>The fatal cone-shaped projection
		was already beginning to form upon
		the silver-faceted side of the nearest
		Devil Crystal. Before the lance-like
		arm of crystal could flash outward,
		Powell sent two bullets crashing
		into the crystal’s side just over
		the opalescent nucleus.</p>

		<p>The leaden missiles caromed harmlessly
		off, as though they had struck
		armor-plate, but the nucleus clouded
		momentarily and the cone-shaped
		projection dissolved back into the
		side.</p>

		<p>With lightning speed Powell
		shifted his aim to the other crystal
		just as its partly-formed arm was
		flashing toward them. His bullet
		crashed into the silvery side squarely
		over the nucleus. Again the bullet’s
		effect was the same. This crystal
		nucleus clouded murkily, and the
		lance-like arm telescoped back into
		the faceted bulk.</p>

		<p>But the effect of the bullets was
		only momentary. Swiftly the nuclei
		<a class="pagenum" id="page359" title="359"> </a>of both crystals cleared. A deep blue
		film, apparently protective in nature,
		formed between the outer wall and
		each nucleus. The cones budded, and
		again the arms started forth.</p>

		<p>Powell fired again, and this time
		uselessly. His bullet struck squarely,
		but the shock of its impact was
		apparently nullified by the protective
		blue film. He emptied his gun in
		a last crashing fusillade, but without
		effect of any kind upon the film-guarded
		nuclei of the giant crystals.</p>

		<p>Their forming arms never wavered
		as they came lancing forward with
		deadly accuracy straight toward
		Joan and Powell. In a last effort to
		save Joan from the terrible doom of
		the crystal lances as long as possible,
		Powell flung his own body as a
		shield in front of the half-fainting
		girl. The tip of one of the crystalline
		arms struck his chest with a
		crashing tinkle of musical glass.</p>

		<p>Instantly the tip sprayed into a
		web of fine filaments that laced on
		around his body. A tinkling shock
		raced through his every nerve from
		the contact with the weird life force
		of the great crystal.</p>

		<p>The arm began contracting. Powell
		was helpless against the terrific
		power of the slender, diamond-hard
		lance of crystal. He felt himself irresistibly
		drawn toward the silver-faceted
		wall of the Devil Crystal.</p>

		<p>His senses reeled in the babel of
		alien sounds—the crashing, glass-like
		music of the crystalline monsters
		and the snarling, squealing,
		paean of jubilant triumph from the
		thousands of rat-men now lining the
		rim of the pit above.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><span class="first_word">Then</span> suddenly the pit, the
		Devil Crystals, and everything
		else in the nightmare world of Arret
		was blotted out in a vast swirling
		cloud of pulsing roseate flame that
		seemed to sweep him bodily up
		into the air and whirl him dizzily
		around.</p>

		<p>His dazed brain staggered from
		the shock of the cataclysmic force
		that was disintegrating an entire
		world around him, but through the
		utter chaos one thought rang clear
		and exultant in his consciousness.</p>

		<p>Benjamin Marlowe had finally
		broadcast the recall wave!</p>

		<p>For what seemed endless eons of
		time Powell hurried through a limitless
		universe of swirling, tinted
		fires, while vibrations of a mighty
		force tingled with poignant ecstasy
		in every atom of his body.</p>

		<p>Then the eddying clouds of flame
		began to coalesce and solidify with
		startling suddenness. A moment
		later, like the abrupt lighting of a
		room when an electric switch is
		snapped, the mists vanished and
		Powell felt firm footing again under
		his feet. Around him were the
		familiar objects of Benjamin Marlowe’s
		laboratory.</p>

		<p>He was standing upon the floor-plate
		in the center of the area
		bounded by the banked green tubes,
		and beside him stood Joan, sobbing
		with relief at their last-minute rescue
		from the Devil Crystals of Arret.
		And over by the control panel
		of the recall mechanism was the
		slight figure of old Benjamin Marlowe,
		with a great joy now shining
		in his faded eyes.</p>
